For profiling with gperftools : 
- compile with -lprofiler
- LD_PRELOAD=/usr/local/lib/libprofiler.so CPUPROFILE=prof.out ./main ssse w 1051 1601 2 (or whatever command we want to use)
- pprof -gv main prof.out (for a graphical representation)
- pprof -tree -cum main prof.out > prof.tree (for a textual representation as some tree of calls sorted by decreasing weight)
